			<Abstract type="html">- RCSensorFusionErrorCodeNone = 0 - No error has occurred.
- RCSensorFusionErrorCodeVision = 1 - No visual features were detected in the most recent image. This is normal in some circumstances, such as quick motion or if the device temporarily looks at a blank wall. However, if this is received repeatedly, it may indicate that the camera is covered or it is too dark. RCSensorFusion will continue.
- RCSensorFusionErrorCodeTooFast = 2 - The device moved more rapidly than expected for typical handheld motion. This may indicate that RCSensorFusion has failed and is providing invalid data. RCSensorFusion will continue.
- RCSensorFusionErrorCodeOther = 3 - A fatal internal error has occured. Please contact RealityCap and provide [RCSensorFusionStatus statusCode] from the status property of the last received RCSensorFusionData object. RCSensorFusion will be reset.
- RCSensorFusionErrorCodeLicense = 4 - A license error indicates that the license has not been properly validated, or needs to be validated again.</Abstract>
